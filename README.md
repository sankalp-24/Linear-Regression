# Linear-Regression

Abstract : A Life Insurance company has gathered the data regarding the customers and wants to analyze it. Different customers have different lifestyles and hence not all can have the same medical expenditures or requirement of health insurance. To better tailor the insurance package to be given to different customers, the company now wants to integrate machine learning into the process and identify the right insurance charges for each customer. You are hired as a ML Engineer to help the company predict the right charges based on the data that they have been maintaining for each customer.

Problem Statement: Predict how much could be the insurance charges for a beneficiary based on the data provided using Linear Regression.



Approach : To predict medical insurance charges based on customer demographics and health indicators.


Tools & Libraries: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn


Key Steps:
	•	Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations (histograms, boxplots, violin plots) to uncover feature relationships.
	•	Identified and corrected target variable skewness using log transformation for better model accuracy.
	•	Handled categorical variables with dummy encoding for model compatibility.
	•	Built a Linear Regression model using OLS to estimate charges.
	•	Evaluated model performance using R² Score, RMSE, and MAE.
	•	Interpreted coefficients to identify key cost-driving factors (e.g., smoking status, BMI, age).



Outcome: Achieved a statistically significant model with meaningful insights into how various features impact insurance costs.
